# Iris Dataset Classification

This project classifies Iris flowers into three species using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset, sourced from a public URL, includes features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The script performs data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Loading**: The Iris dataset is loaded from a URL.
2. **Data Exploration**: Basic exploration including data types, missing values, and target variable distribution.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Splitting features and target variable.
   - Encoding the target variable using `LabelEncoder`.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Training a Logistic Regression model.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix are computed and displayed.

## Files

- `iris_classification.py`: Python script containing the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Code Explanation

1. **Loading and Exploring Data**:
   - The dataset is loaded and basic exploration is performed to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Features are separated from the target variable.
   - Target variable (`species`) is encoded to numerical values for model training.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - The data is split into training and testing sets.
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained.
   - Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## How to Run

1. Ensure required dependencies are installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python iris_classification.py
   ```

## Results

The script outputs:
- Accuracy of the model.
- Classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- Confusion matrix showing true vs. predicted classifications.

## Notes

- The Logistic Regression model is configured with a maximum of 1000 iterations for convergence.
- For further improvements, consider exploring other algorithms and parameter tuning.
